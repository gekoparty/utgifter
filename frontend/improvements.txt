1 right now, the useExpense fetches all shops and enrice them with locations,
need to find a way to only enrich the ones actually needed on 1st and 2nd page to optimeze http loads
The Compromise: Batching + Hydrating the Cache

2 The fetchShopsDataOptimized inside useExpense hook that enrices shops with locations can be extracted to make a generic 
enericer function to work also with useProduct screen and possibly other
🌟 Refactoring: Creating a Generic Batch Merger

3 need to search for a useFetchData call with only three arguments (queryKey, url, transformData):

4 fetchconfig can be adressed inside useFetchData instead and removed in useExpense and other 

6 in useFetchData we are getting all brands, all shop, this is overfetching since we only fetch 10 expenses

6 check the use of errorboundary in useFetchdata, and use of options
const queryResult = useQuery({

    queryKey: stableQueryKey,

    queryFn: fetchData,

    enabled: options.enabled !== false,

    retry: options.retry ?? 3,

    staleTime: options.staleTime ?? 5 * 60 * 1000,

    cacheTime: options.cacheTime ?? 10 * 60 * 1000,

    useErrorBoundary: options.useErrorBoundary ?? true, // ✅ Supports Suspense

    ...options,

  });
